  <h1>Hello Everyone!</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my website! This clearly isnt your average website. I am working on a career change and using GitHub as a platform to enhance my learned skills. 
  Please feel free to browse and leave any constructive criticism you may have. My goal is to be a software engineer with solid syntax and a strong understanding of my chosen 
  coding languages. Any advice would be much appreciated. </p>
